🧠 CONTEXT (VERY IMPORTANT)

I already have an ASP.NET Clean Architecture solution with the following structure:

ELogBook.sln
│
├── ELogBook.API
├── ELogBook.Application
├── ELogBook.Domain
├── ELogBook.Infrastructure
└── ELogBook.WebUI


I want you to focus ONLY on ELogBook.WebUI and generate ready-to-use HTML, CSS, JS, and Razor layout files that will work seamlessly with ASP.NET MVC / Razor Pages.

⚠️ DO NOT mix backend logic or APIs
⚠️ DO NOT write controllers or services
⚠️ UI must be API-ready but API calls can be mocked

🎯 OBJECTIVE

Create a production-quality Pharma E-Log Book Web UI with:

ASP.NET MVC / Razor-compatible structure

Clean HTML + CSS + JavaScript

Pharma-style professional UI

Forms, tables, dashboards, layouts

Easy integration with APIs later

🛠 TECHNOLOGY REQUIREMENTS (STRICT)

HTML5

CSS3

Bootstrap 5

Vanilla JavaScript (no React, no Angular)

Razor Layout support (_Layout.cshtml)

Partial Views (_Sidebar.cshtml, _Header.cshtml)

Compatible with ASP.NET Core MVC

📁 REQUIRED FOLDER STRUCTURE (INSIDE ELogBook.WebUI)

Generate files EXACTLY in this structure:

ELogBook.WebUI
│
├── wwwroot
│   ├── css
│   │   └── site.css
│   ├── js
│   │   └── site.js
│   └── images
│
├── Views
│   ├── Shared
│   │   ├── _Layout.cshtml
│   │   ├── _Header.cshtml
│   │   └── _Sidebar.cshtml
│   │
│   ├── Account
│   │   └── Login.cshtml
│   │
│   ├── Dashboard
│   │   └── Index.cshtml
│   │
│   ├── Equipment
│   │   ├── Index.cshtml
│   │   └── Create.cshtml
│   │
│   ├── LogBook
│   │   ├── Index.cshtml
│   │   └── Create.cshtml
│   │
│   ├── AuditTrail
│   │   └── Index.cshtml
│   │
│   └── Reports
│       └── Index.cshtml

🎨 UI DESIGN RULES

Use Bootstrap cards, tables, forms

Pharma clean look (light colors, minimal icons)

No flashy animations

Focus on readability & audit clarity

🧠 JAVASCRIPT RULES

All JS goes into wwwroot/js/site.js

Use dummy JSON data

Structure JS functions as if APIs exist

Example:

loadEquipmentList();
submitLogEntry();

📌 IMPORTANT INSTRUCTIONS

Generate actual file contents, not pseudo-code

Each file must be ready to run

Use Razor syntax where required

Add comments explaining:

Purpose of file

Where API will be connected later

Assume this will be used in a GMP audited system

🚀 FINAL EXPECTATION

When done:

I should be able to open ELogBook.WebUI

Run the app

Navigate UI fully

Later connect APIs from ELogBook.API without changing UI

❗ DO NOT

Do not generate backend logic

Do not use React / Angular

Do not skip files

Do not oversimplify UI

✅ START NOW

Generate all files step-by-step and clearly mention:
File Name → File Path → Full Content
