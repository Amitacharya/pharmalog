🎯 Project Title

Pharma E-Log Book & Equipment Activity Management System

🧩 Objective

Design and develop a pharma-compliant, web-based E-Log Book system that replaces manual logbooks used in pharmaceutical manufacturing plants.
The system must support electronic activity logging, equipment master management, audit trails, preventive maintenance, and compliance reporting aligned with 21 CFR Part 11, GAMP-5, and ALCOA+ principles.

This application will be server-hosted and accessed via web browsers on local client machines.

🏗️ Overall Architecture

Build a secure, scalable, modular web application using clean architecture and role-based access control.

Architecture Layers

Frontend (Web UI)

Backend (API & Business Logic)

Database

Authentication & Authorization

Audit & Compliance Layer

🛠️ Recommended Technology Stack
Backend

ASP.NET Core (.NET 8 LTS or .NET 7 if 8 unavailable)

RESTful Web API

Entity Framework Core

JWT Authentication + Refresh Tokens

Serilog for audit logging

Frontend

React + TypeScript

Material UI (MUI) or Bootstrap 5

Form validation with controlled components

Role-aware UI rendering

(If simpler MVP is needed, use Razor Pages or Blazor Server)

Database

SQL Server

Tables with immutable audit records

Time stored in UTC

Soft deletes (IsDeleted flag)

Hosting / Deployment

Windows Server / Azure VM / On-Prem Server

IIS or Kestrel

HTTPS enforced

Daily database backup strategy

🔐 Security & Compliance Requirements
Authentication

Username + Password

Password policy (min length, expiry, history)

Optional 2FA (future ready)

Account lockout after failed attempts

Authorization

Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)

Roles:

Operator

Supervisor

QA

Engineer

Admin

21 CFR Part 11 Compliance

Secure login

🚨 Important Instruction

Develop this as a real production-ready pharma system, not a demo.
Assume the software will be audited.
